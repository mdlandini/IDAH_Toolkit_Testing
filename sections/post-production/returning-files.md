### Returning Files with Mail Merge
This section ccovers how to send contributors their contributions using a mail merge feature. 
> Note: For this guide, we will be using Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Word on a Microsoft365 Account. The process for mail merge is roughly the same across systems, but youu might have to Google *"insert system mail merge"*.

1. To start, the email that you are wanting to send the contributions back from must be ***the default email*** account in Outlook. 
    - To set this, navigate to Settings -> Accounts to view all accounts, select the account you want as the default, and on Mac, use the arrows in the bottom left corner to move the email to the top/on PC, sign-in with the email account you want to use.

2. With Outlook still open, navigate to Word and draft the email to send back to contributors.
    - We have a template available for download <a href="https://github.com/mdlandini/idah_toolkit_testing/blob/main/assets/images/Email%20Template%20for%20Sharing%20Files.docx" target="here" />
