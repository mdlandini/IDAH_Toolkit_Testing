## How to Download and Open an Audio File 
This section covers how to download and open an audio file from your computer. During the collection event, you will have retrieved the audio file from the recording device, renamed it, and stored it in a folder.  
 
> Note: If you are using an online storage software such as OneDrive or Google Drive, and you are not using a transcription software, you may not need to download the file to your local computer. 
 
### How to Download an Audio File 
> Note: The screen captures used during this section are from Google Drive and will use an arbitrary Object ID, used to show the file naming convention suggested earlier in this guide. 
 
The steps are as follows to download an audio file: 
1. Click on the three dots next to the file name 
2. Select “Download” 
3. Locate the file on your local computer. By default, this will be your Downloads folder 
 
### How to Open an Audio File 
To open an audio file, simply double-click on the file on your computer. This will open the file in your computer’s default media player. This is the common way to open an audio file to transcribe it without the use of a transcription software. 
 
> Note: If you are using audio captured on a smartphone, you might encounter some errors when trying to open audio captured on any Android device on an iOS/Mac device and vice versa. This will normally be caused by a file-format difference. We are still trying to troubleshoot this problem. 
 
For opening an audio file using a transcription software, there will traditionally be an “Upload Audio” button. 

## Transcribing without Access to Transcription Software 
This section covers the best practices for transcribing audio files without the use of 3rd-party software.

### How to Transcribe an Audio File 
This covers the best practices for transcribing an audio file manually. This is a tedious and time-consuming process, so do not be detoured by the process. 
 
Here are some notes for best practices: 
- Listen to the audio file a few seconds at a time to transcribe. Do not try to transcript larger chunks at one time 
- Replay sections as needed for clarity 
- Some audio players allow for audio to be slowed down. If a section is going too fast, this is an option 
- Adjust the volume level as needed for audio levels. Depending on the quality of the oral history interview, the audio recording may be louder or quieter than normal 
- Write down all spoken words 
- You and your team will need to decide whether or not to include various words and punctuation (see What to Include in a Transcription section) 
 
## Transcribing with Access to Transcription Software 
This section covers the best practices for transcribing audio files with the use of 3rd-party software.
 
We recommend, if possible, to use a Microsoft365 account version of OneDrive for this process. Using Microsoft Word in OneDrive allows for the transcript to be placed in the same folder as the audio file and other files for each contribution. 
Information on purchasing a Microsoft365 Account can be found here. 
If you only plan on using Microsoft365, the cost (as of November 2023) is: 
- Personal (1) Account: $6.99/month or $69.99/year 
- Family (up to 6) Account: $9.99/Month or $99.99/year 
> Notes:  
> For this section, all screen captures will be from using Microsoft Word through OneDrive, with a Microsoft365 account. 
> Transcription software is not 100% accurate. Additional clean-up will be needed. 
> If your audio file has more than one language in it, you may have to run the file through the software in each language or you may need to transcribe the second language by hand. 
 
### How to Import an Audio File 
To import an audio file: 
1. Select “Dictate” from the Home Toolbar 
2. From the dropdown menu, select “Transcribe” 
3. Select “Upload Audio” 
 This menu gives the option to select the language that the audio file is in.  
 If the audio file contains more than one language, see notes above. 
4. Select the file from your computer to upload 
 This uploads the audio file to the computer and runs the transcribing program on it. This process takes anywhere from a few seconds to minutes, depending on the file size. 

### The Transcript 

 
Once the audio file has been transcribed, it will appear in the side panel. 
 
By default, the transcript will show the file name over the audio options, timestamps, and which speaker is speaking. 
 
The audio controls are pinned to the top of this panel, allowing you to edit the transcript as the file is playing, without the need to scroll each time.  
 
Notice that not all the text from one speaker is under the same timestamp. This is because Microsoft Word’s (and other transcription software) transcription feature transcribes by when words are spoken. 
 
Once the transcript has been fully edited, they will be condensed under one “Speaker 1”. 
 
 
 
To edit the transcript: 
Hover your cursor over the text box. A pencil icon will appear 
 
Select the pencil icon to open up the editing options 
 
This allows you to edit the name of the speaker and the text that was transcribed 
If the checkbox labeled “Change all Speaker 1” is checked, this will change all “Speaker 1” labeled timestamps to the name inputted 
 
 
Notice that all the “Speaker 1” timestamps have now changed 
You can also update the transcription here. This example is updating the Object ID in the transcript 
 
Once all the change to the transcript have been made. Select “Add to document” at the bottom of the panel 
 
There are multiple options that can be selected here: 
Just text 
Text only. No speakers or timestamps will be added to the Word document 
With speakers 
The speaker’s name will be added to the Word document with the transcription 
If there are multiple sections of the same speaker in the transcript in a row, they will be grouped together 
With timestamps 
The timestamps will be added to the Word document, separating when words were spoken 
With speakers and timestamps 
Both the timestamp and the speaker will be added to the Word document 
 
 
After selecting an option, the transcript will auto populate in the Word document 
 
 
Notice a few things: 
The audio file is hyperlinked at the beginning of the transcript. This makes it easier for the person who contributed the oral history to locate and listen to it 
The transcript is labeled and separated by the speaker, with all the transcriptions grouped under their name 
Other transcription softwares don’t include the audio file in the transcription and require additional steps to export the transcript into a readable document. This is the reason we recommend using a Microsoft365 account, OneDrive, and Word within OneDrive.  
 
### Best Practices for Cleaning a Generated Transcript 
Transcription software is not 100% accurate.  
 
Some common erros the software makes include: 
Adding in punctuation based on breaks in the audio and tone of voice 
Misspelling names and locations 
Inserting the wrong word 
Many more 
 
When cleaning a generated transcript: 
Listen to the audio carefully and in small chunks to follow along and fix the errors easily 
It is possible that a word or phrase was not recognized by the transcription software and is therefore not in the transcript 
Do not add in punctuation while editing in the side panel 
Add and remove punctuation once the transcript has been added to the document 
Decide on whether to include pause-words such as “um” and “like” in the final transcript (see more below) 
If another language is present, remember you have two options: 
Upload the audio file in another document with the second language selected  
Transcribe the second language by hand 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
## What to Include in a Transcription 
This is a common question that we as a team at IDAH constantly struggle with. Do we include every “um” or “like” in the transcript for its full authenticity? Do we go through and correct the grammar? Do we remove the duplicated words? The answer to these and similar questions, unfortunately, is that it is up to you, your team, and the overarching goals of your community archive. 
### For Returning Files to Contributors 
For returning the contributor’s raw files, clean up for the transcription should be kept to a minimum. This includes: 
Naming who is speaking throughout the transcript using the naming convention you and your team decide on 
Flagging words and/or phrases and having another person listen to the transcription for any low-quality or soft-spoken sections 
Keeping the files and the transcript alteration at a minimum allows for the contributor to have their experience preserved best.

### Preparing Files for Upload 
For preparing the transcripts for upload, normally the cleaner the transcript, the better. This includes: 
Naming who is speaking throughout the transcript using the naming convention you and your team decide on 
Flagging words and/or phrases and having another person listen to the transcription for any low-quality or soft-spoken sections 
Deciding on whether or not to have timestamps added throughout the transcript 
“00:00:01 Interviewer: Example Question Here”  
“00:01:34 Contributor Name: Example Response Here” 
Or: 
“Interviewer: Example Transcript Here” 
“Contributor Name: Example Response” 
Removing repeated words 
Removing pause-words such as “um” and “like” 
 
When preparing transcripts for uploading, think of someone reading them like they would read a book or a published newspaper interview: 
What information would they need to read in the transcript in order to get the best picture of what was talked about? 
What would you and your team include from the transcript so the reader could feel like they were listening to the recording and not just reading it?
