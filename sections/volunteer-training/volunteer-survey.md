This document covers each of the surveys found in this folder. Each survey covers a different area and time, starting at the gauging interest stage, through training availability.

Each survey will be broken down into the different sections through sub-headings that it contains. Within each section, we have provided language for you and your team to start. This language is a suggestion to start, but gives you and your team flexibility when creating these surveys.

Any **bold text** surrounded by brackets is used as a placeholder for you and your team to help guide you through the language you want to use.

### Volunteer & Skills Interest Survey
The purpose of this survey is to gauge interest and the skill level of those who are interested in volunteering for the collection event. Below is an outline that you and your team can copy over into a Google Form to send out. The language that we have provided is simply a template. An example survey can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwW66tVH7RIJcI-OO7qQl_YXooxhcH6QOMn7CbnOX3mRSHnQ/viewform?usp=sharing) 

#### Body of the Survey:
Digital storytelling is a powerful form of sharing personal experiences that enables individuals and communities to proclaim and reclaim their cultural identities and narratives through personal and meaningful items like photos or home movies. For the **insert event name here**, we are especially interested in archiving an object and story from **community name here** that will form part of the **project/community archive name here**. 

We are looking for volunteers in several capacities. **insert if trainings will be in-person, asynchronous, or a combination of both here**
  - E.g., “There will be asynchronous and in-person training sessions before the event.”

Kindly complete the form below to indicate your interest. We will follow-up with information about the **insert training type here** by **insert follow-up date here**. 

#### Contact Information
There are two recommended types of contact information that we recommend are gathered to use for contacting volunteers:
  - Email Address
  - Name

Each of following should be their own question on the form:

Areas of Interest (Ranking – instead of “multiple select”)
  1. Reception
  2. Guide (Escorting contributors through the collection process)
  3. Photographer (using personal smartphones)
  4. Video Capture and Digitization Technician (using provided equipment)
  5. Interviewer for Video Narration (using provided equipment)
  6. Interviewer for Oral Histories (using personal smartphones)
  7. Post-processing of digital contributions 
  8. Website development 

Skills-at-a-Glance (slide scale, very comfortable - not comfortable)
  - Phone for photographing
  - Phone for audio recording
  - Video transfer and editing 
  - Spreadsheets for data entry 
  - File management (moving, copying, uploading, etc.)
  - Web site design and development (HTML/CSS or using frameworks like WordPress or Wix)

Describe skills (input field)

### Volunteer & Training Survey: Artifact Collection
The purpose of this survey is to gauge when people are going to be able to attend your in-person trainings. Below is an outline that you and your team can copy over into a Google Form to send out. The language that we have provided is simply a template:

You have indicated interest in learning about and helping the **community name** with digitizing artifacts and collecting oral histories about those artifacts and the community member’s connection to the **community name**. For the actual event, volunteers will serve in one role/capacity at a time – reception, guide, photographer or interviewer–but because the process is inter-connected, the training will focus on all parts of the process. 

Asynchronous training materials will be distributed one week before the in-person training, with the expectation that introductory training will be conducted by the volunteers ahead of the in-person training session. Review of the introductory self-directed, asynchronous training materials should take no more than **time commitment for independent study** of your time. In addition, asynchronous materials will be provided based on the role you chose on the day of the community archiving event, **date and time of your collection event**. This will allow you to refer to specific information about your chosen role and just review that section of the training materials.   

The in-person training is scheduled to last no more than **time commitment for in-person training**. We have set aside the following dates/time slots. Please indicate your availability by checking all slots that would work with your schedule so we can narrow down the training dates and times. 
  - **This is where you will list your dates and times for in-person training.**

### Volunteer & Training Survey: Remixing Home Movies
The purpose of this survey is to gauge when people are going to be able to attend your in-person trainings for digital video capture and recording. Below is an outline that you and your team can copy over into a Google Form to send out. The language that we have provided is simply a template:

You have indicated interest in learning about and helping the **community name** with video digitization/capture, and interviewing the community member about the video submitted and its/their connection to the **community name**. For the actual event, volunteers will serve in one role/capacity at a time – video technician or interviewer – but because the process is inter-connected, the training will focus on both parts of the process. This training  session will focus on the activities associated with video capture and digitization and interview techniques with the contributor about the video they provided. This training session will occur on **training date**.    

Asynchronous training materials will be distributed one week before the in-person training, with the expectation that introductory training will be conducted by the volunteers ahead of the in-person training session. Review of the introductory self-directed, asynchronous training materials should take no more than **time commitment** of your time. In addition, asynchronous materials will be provided based on the role you chose on the day of the community archiving event, **date and time of your collection event**. This will allow you to refer to specific information about your chosen role and just review that section of the training materials.   

The in-person training is scheduled to last no more than **time commitment**. We have set aside the following dates/time slots. Please indicate your availability by checking all slots that would work with your schedule so we can narrow down the training dates and times.
